3. Subscription Terms
1. Subscription Model
MasterCourse is a paid-access application. We do not offer a free tier. To access the learning content and AI tools, you must maintain an active subscription.

2. Free Trial
We offer a 3-day free trial for new users.

You will not be charged if you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends.

If you do not cancel, the trial will automatically convert into a paid subscription.

3. Billing & Renewal

Payment Processing: All payments are charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.

Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Charges: Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate selected.

4. Cancellation
You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID Settings.

Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions > MasterCourse > Cancel Subscription.

Canceling turns off auto-renewal; you will retain access until the end of your current billing cycle. Deleting the App does not cancel your subscription.

5. Refunds
Since MasterCourse is purchased through the Apple App Store, ONE MISSION GROUP LTD. does not have the ability to process refunds directly.

All refund requests must be submitted to Apple.

Visit https://www.google.com/search?q=reportaproblem.apple.com to request a refund. Apple handles these requests based on their own refund policies.

6. Price Changes
We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service. Any price changes will be communicated to you in advance and, if applicable, will require your consent to continue the subscription via Apple's notification system.
